# CENG 317: CHARLI0x74
## Week 11[Nov 13,2018 ]
#### Progress Report
-Generally Python reduces one's workload exponentially, Hence everyone should try to code their program in Python. <br>-But most of the codes or libraries available on internet & on various website are written in either C or C++ for Arduino as thier circuit board.<br>-After some reseach when I found a way, how to run Arduino **sketches**(code) on Raspberry pi. I attched the URL for the specific video which could solve this issue.<br>        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZvhtfUlY8Y <br>-In this video the programmer is exportng sketches as binary files and that binary files are run on raspberry pi.<br>-The file below is shows some commands which helped me as Python user to make my LEDs working.However a detailed file can be found in **Documents Folder** in this repository.<br>



## Week 10[Nov 6,2018]
#### Progress Report
-My earlier PCB did'nt work(or did'n fit). Actually the files which I downloaded from github(related to my sensor for fritzing) were not *appropriate*.<br> 
-I was unable flip my sensor hence when it came to soldering the connection went wrong, Hence I redesigned my PCB with logically *incorrect* but *physically* correct port connections.<br>
-Thanks to prototype lab my new board was handed over to me very next day. I was able to solder it on time.<br>
-Fortunately even after this much of choas no additional cost added. 

- Soldering Milestone Due<br>

- PCB soldering to be done by next week.
#### Progress Report:
-Used fritzing to design my PCB.The issue with fritzing is that it does not include all the senors. Hence some sensors are not there hence PCB desiginig becomes tougher.  
-There are two ways to resolve this issue either use header pins rather than using sensor or download it from github. Just google the name of sensor followed by word "fritzing". Download the file and open it with Fritzing.Sensor will show up.  
-No additional cost added. 

## Week 8[Oct 23,2018]
- Breadbord Assembly Milestone due.
- Micro-controller and LED matrix were soldered together and embedded on breadboard later.
#### Progress Report
-One thing which troubled me was the sides of micro-controller that is which side was supposed to go in breadbord and which was sto be soldered with LED's. Then I reffered to online documentaion on adafruit and was abkle to resolve the problem.   
-No additional cost added.

## Week 7[Oct 16,2018]
- Showed acquisitions.
- Watched videoes related to soldering.
- had discussion in class related to safety.
- Submitted Pseudo Code assignment on blackboard.
## Week 6[Oct 9,2018]
- Study Day No Class!!!
- Contacted group members from first semester to discuss Pseudo Code.
- My sensor and raspberri pi arrived.Ready to show them in class next week.

## Week 5[Oct 2, 2018]
### Proof of Payment
#### Reciept of Raspberry pi
Two Groups ordered Raspberry pies together hence saving lot of money from shipping.

#### Reciept of sensors and Micro Controllers
Me and my partner ordered Sensors together and saved on shipping fees again.

#### Reciept of Jumper Wires
Other two reciepts which I have posted are images and I tried to do something different this time. Hence,I have posted a pdf file of the reciept.
