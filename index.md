- PCB design Due.  

- PCB soldering to be done by next week.
#### Progress Report:
-Used fritzing to design my PCB.TH eissue with fritzing is that it does not include all the senors. Hence some sensors are not there hence PCB desiginig becomes tougher.  
-There are two ways to resolve this issue either use header pins rather than using sensor or download it from github. Just google the name of sensor followed by word "fritzing". Download the file and open it with Fritzing.Sensor will show up.  
-No additional cost added. 

## Week 8[Oct 23,2018]
- Breadbord Assembly Milestone due.
- Micro-controller and LED matrix were soldered together and embedded on breadboard later.
#### Progress Report
-One thing which troubled me was the sides of micro-controller that is which side was supposed to go in breadbord and which was sto be soldered with LED's. Then I reffered to online documentaion on adafruit and was abkle to resolve the problem.   
-No additional cost added.

## Week 5[Oct 2, 2018]
### Proof of Payment
#### Reciept of Raspberry pi
Two Groups ordered Raspberry pies together hence saving lot of money from shipping.
